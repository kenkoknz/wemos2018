Before writing the program, a channel was created in Thingspeak to store temperature data. The channel number and write API key are used in the program to send data to Thingspeak. Please check the attached file for the code. Inlcuded libraries are ThingSpeak.h and ESP8266WiFi.h . Program was uploaded to Wemos D1 R2 ESP8266 board using USB. The factor of 0.322 was used to convert analog reading of LM35 to convert to temp in degrees centigrade since sensor was connected to 3.3V of ESP8266.

Program:

#include <ThingSpeak.h>

#include<ESP8266WiFi.h>

 

const char*ssid= “Your internet id”;

const char* password=”Your internet password”;

const char* server= “api.thingspeak.com”;

float temp= 0;

int analog=0;

 

WiFiClient client;

unsigned long myChannelNumber = your channel number from Thingspeak;

const char * myWriteAPIKey = “Your api key”;

 

void setup() {

  // put your setup code here, to run once:

Serial.begin(9600);

delay(10);

WiFi.begin(ssid, password);

Serial.println();

Serial.println();

Serial.print(“Connecting to”);

Serial.println(ssid);

WiFi.begin(ssid, password);

while( WiFi.status()!=WL_CONNECTED){

  delay(500);

  Serial.print(“.”);

}

Serial.println(“”);

Serial.println(“WiFi connected”);

ThingSpeak.begin(client);

}

 

void loop() {

  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

analog=analogRead(17);

float temp= 0.322*analog;

 

  Serial.print(“Temeperature:”);

  Serial.print(temp);

  Serial.print(“%send to Thingspeak”);

Serial.println(“Waiting…”);

ThingSpeak.writeField(myChannelNumber, 1, temp, myWriteAPIKey);

delay(20000);

}
